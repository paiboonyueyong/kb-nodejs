# Process managers for Express apps
When you run Express apps for production, it is helpful to use a process manager to achieve the following tasks:

Restart the app automatically if it crashes.
Gain insights into runtime performance and resource consumption.
Modify settings dynamically to improve performance.
Control clustering.
A process manager is somewhat like an application server: it’s a “container” for applications that facilitates deployment, provides high availability, and enables you to manage the application at runtime.

The most popular process managers for Express and other Node.js applications are as follows:

* Forever
* PM2
* StrongLoop Process Manager
* SystemD
